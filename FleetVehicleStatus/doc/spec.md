## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `bearing`: The current bearing of the fleet vehicle in degrees relative to North. The timestamp element of the attribute should indicate when the reading was obtained.  - `currentOperative`: The current operative (e.g. driver) of the vehicle described as a Schema.org  person  - `currentStatus`: A description of the current status of the vehicle e.g. Enum:'deployed, finished, terminated, servicing, starting'  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `fleetVehicle`: Reference to the FleetVehicle entity to which this status entity relates.  - `fleetVehicleOperation`: Reference to the FleetVehicleOperation entity to which this status entity relates.  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `inRestrictedArea`: Indicates if the vehicle is known to be in a restricted area at the time of the status update.  - `lastFuellingAmount`: The level of fuel added to the vehicle at the last fuelling. The timestamp element of the attribute should indicate when the vehicle was fuelled. Data to be recorded in Litres  - `lastKnownPosition`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `lastKnownPositionUpdatedAt`: The timestamp of the last known position update for the fleet vehicle.  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `mileageFromOdometer`: The total distance the fleet vehicle has travelled according to the on-board odometer in kilometres (unitCode KMT) or miles (unitCode SMI). See also Schema.org Vehicle/ mileageFromOdometer. The timestamp element records when the odometer reading was taken.  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `restFuelAmount`: The level of fuel recorded when the vehicle was last at rest (i.e. stopped). The timestamp element of the attribute should indicate when the vehicle was last at rest. Data to be recorded in Litres.  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `speed`: The current speed of the fleet vehicle (km/h). The timestamp element of the attribute should indicate when the reading was obtained  - `type`: NGSI Entity identifier. It has to be FleetVehicleStatus

#### FleetVehicleStatus NGSI-v2 key-values Example    
Here is an example of a FleetVehicleStatus in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.
