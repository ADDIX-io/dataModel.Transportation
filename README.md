# dataModel.Transportation
These data models describe the main entities involved with smart applications that deal with transportation issues. This set of entities is primarily associated with the Automotive and Smart City vertical segments and related IoT applications.
When feasible, references to existing schema.org entity types and attributes are included.
These models have been devised to be as generic as possible, thus allowing to deal with different scenarios
- Traffic flow monitoring - Private Vehicles. - Public Vehicles (Buses, Trains, etc.). - Municipal Vehicles (pick up lorries, cleaning units, ...) - Special Vehicles (ambulances, fire brigades, ...)

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [BikeHireDockingStation](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/blob/master/BikeHireDockingStation/README.md). Bike Hire Docking Station

- [CrowdFlowObserved](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/blob/master/CrowdFlowObserved/README.md). CrowdFlowObserved

- [EVChargingStation](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/blob/master/EVChargingStation/README.md). EV Charging Station

- [Road](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/blob/master/Road/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised geographic and contextual description of a road.

- [RoadSegment](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/blob/master/RoadSegment/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised geographic and contextual description of a road segment. A collection of road segments are used to describe a Road.

- [TrafficFlowObserved](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/blob/master/TrafficFlowObserved/README.md). An observation of traffic flow conditions at a certain place and time.

- [TransportStation](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/blob/master/TransportStation/README.md). The data model is a general description of urban stations (Metro, Bus, Tram, Heliport, ...) according to the GFTS standard https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#stopstxt, as well the detailed description of these (means of access, platform, assistance, ...).

- [Vehicle](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/blob/master/Vehicle/README.md). This entity models a particular vehicle model, including all properties which are common to multiple vehicle instances belonging to such model.

- [VehicleModel](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/blob/master/VehicleModel/README.md). This entity models a particular vehicle model, including all properties which are common to multiple vehicle instances belonging to such model.
