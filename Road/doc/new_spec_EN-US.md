Entity: Road  
============  
This specification is a **temporal version**. It is automatically generated from the  documented properties described in the schema.json condensed into the file `model.yaml`. A temporary `new_model.yaml` file has been created in every data model to avoid impacting into existing scripts. Thus, the specification will be incomplete as long as the schema.json is not updated to the new format (documenting properties). Once updated the `model.yaml` (`new_model.yaml`) needs to be updated as well (automatically) . Further info in this [link](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/specs/warning_message_new_spec.md). As long as it is a provisional format any [feedback is welcomed in this form](https://smartdatamodels.org/index.php/submit-an-issue-2/) choosing option `Feedback on the new specification`

Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. It has to be Road    
Required properties  
Roads are made up of one or more RoadSegment entities. Road segments are usually used to model the different carriageways of highways, for instance. The presence of dedicated bicycle lanes should be modelled using road segments as well. Road segments also play an important role when modelling roads with heterogeneous segments, for instance segments on which speed limits are different. This entity is primarily associated with the Automotive and Smart City vertical segments and related IoT applications. This data model has been developed in cooperation with mobile operators and the GSMA.
