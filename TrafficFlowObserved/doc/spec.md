Global description: **An observation of traffic flow conditions at a certain place and time.**  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `averageGapDistance`: Average gap distance between consecutive vehicles  - `averageHeadwayTime`: Average headway time. Headway time is the time ellapsed between two consecutive vehicles  - `averageVehicleLength`: Average length of the vehicles transiting during  
    the observation period  - `averageVehicleSpeed`: Average speed of the vehicles transiting during the observation period  - `congested`:  Flags whether there was a traffic congestion during the observation period in the referred lane. The absence of this attribute means no traffic congestion  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateObserved`: The date and time of this observation in ISO8601 UTC format. It can be represented by an specific time instant or by an ISO8601 interval. As a workaround for the lack of support of Orion Context Broker for datetime intervals, it can be used two separate attributes: `dateObservedFrom`, `dateObservedTo`. [DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime) or an ISO8601 interval represented as [Text](https://schema.org/Text)  - `dateObservedFrom`: Observation period start date and time. See `dateObserved`  - `dateObservedTo`: Observation period end date and time. See `dateObserved`  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `intensity`: Total number of vehicles detected during this observation period  - `laneDirection`: Usual direction of travel in the lane referred by this observation. This attribute is useful when the observation is not referencing any road segment, allowing to know the direction of travel of the traffic flow observed. Enum:forward, backward'. See RoadSegment for a description of the semantics of these values.  - `laneId`: Lane identifier. Lane identification is done using the conventions defined by RoadSegment entity which are based on [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Forward_%26_backward,_left_%26_right).  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `occupancy`: Fraction of the observation time where a vehicle has been occupying the observed lane  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `refRoadSegment`: Concerned road segment on which the observation has been made. Reference to an entity of type RoadSegment  - `reversedLane`: Flags whether traffic in the lane was reversed during the observation period. The absence of this attribute means no lane reversion  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. It has to be TrafficFlowObserved  - `vehicleSubType`: It allows to specify a sub type of `vehicleType`, eg if the `vehicleType` is set to `Lorry` the `vehicleSubType` may be `OGV1` or `OGV2` to convey more information about the exact type of vehicle.  - `vehicleType`: Type of vehicle from the point of view of its structural characteristics. Enum:'agriculturalVehicle, bicycle, bus, minibus, car, caravan, tram, tanker, carWithCaravan, carWithTrailer, lorry, moped, motorcycle, motorcycleWithSideCar, motorscooter, trailer, van, constructionOrMaintenanceVehicle, trolley, binTrolley, sweepingMachine, cleaningTrolley'    
Required properties  
- `dateObserved`  - `id`  - `type`    
This entity is primarily associated with the Automotive and Smart City vertical segments and related IoT applications.
