notesPrevious:
  These data models describe the main entities involved with smart applications
  that deal with transportation issues. This set of entities is primarily
  associated with the Automotive and Smart City vertical segments and related IoT
  applications.

  When feasible, references to existing schema.org entity types and attributes are
  included.

  These models have been devised to be as generic as possible, thus allowing to
  deal with different scenarios

    - Traffic flow monitoring
    - Private Vehicles.
    - Public Vehicles (Buses, Trains, etc.).
    - Municipal Vehicles (pick up lorries, cleaning units, ...)
    - Special Vehicles (ambulances, fire brigades, ...)
